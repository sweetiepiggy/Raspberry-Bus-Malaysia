    DESCRIPTION

    Tired of poor express bus service? Use and contribute to this crowd-sourced
    app to keep the express bus companies accountable for their service.

    Available in English, Chinese (覆盆子巴士马来西亚) and Bahasa Malaysia
    (Raspberi Bas Ekspres).

    Are you frustrated with frequent delays? Were you lied to? Did the bus
    not stop where you were told it would? Were you dropped by the side of
    the road? Was the driver drunk? Use this app to track the service of the
    express bus companies so you and others can avoid repeating the same
    mistake.

    Please help to improve the usefulness of this app by submitting a review
    of each express bus trip you make.

    Feedback and suggestions for improvement are most welcome.
