    DESCRIPTION

    Tired of poor express bus service? Use and contribute to this crowd-sourced
    app to keep the express bus companies accountable for their service.

    Are you frustrated with frequent delays? Were you lied to by the salesman at
    the counter? Did the bus not stop where you were told it would? Were you
    dropped by the side of the road? Use this app to track the service of the
    express companies so you and others can avoid repeating the same mistake.

    Feedback and suggestions for improvement are most welcome.
